# Udacity Projects Portfolio

This repository contains project work completed as part of various [Udacity Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/) programs. As a product manager with a growing focus on technical depth, I'm using these projects to deepen my skills in AI, machine learning, and data-driven product development.

Each subfolder represents a standalone project or course module, with code, documentation, and results where applicable.

## üß† Nanodegree Tracks

### 1. Generative AI Nanodegree
Projects focused on large language models (LLMs), fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and efficient deployment techniques.

- **[PEFT Emotion Classifier](./generative-ai/peft-emotion-classifier.ipynb)**  
  Fine-tuned a BERT-based model using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to classify emotions in text.  
  Includes training and evaluation on the `dair-ai/emotion` dataset.  
  *(See `/generative-ai` folder for details)*

### 2. (Future) Natural Language Processing Nanodegree
Planned coursework on tokenization, language modeling, and sequence-to-sequence tasks.  
Projects will include sentiment analysis, machine translation, and summarization.

### 3. AI Product Manager Nanodegree
Projects exploring the intersection of product management and machine learning, including responsible AI deployment, user trust, and aligning AI capabilities with business goals.

### 4. Data Product Manager Nanodegree
Projects focused on defining product metrics, collaborating with data teams, and leveraging analytics for strategy and experimentation.

### 5. Growth Product Manager Nanodegree
Projects centered on product-led growth, user acquisition and retention, A/B testing, and growth modeling.
