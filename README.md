# üß† Udacity Projects Portfolio

This repository showcases project work completed by **Harish Lingam** as part of various [Udacity Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/) programs. As a product manager with a growing focus on technical depth, I'm leveraging these projects to deepen my skills in AI, machine learning, and data-informed product development.

Each subfolder contains standalone project work, complete with documentation, data analysis, and strategic deliverables.

## üéì Nanodegree Tracks

### 1. AI Product Manager Nanodegree (`ai-product-manager-nanodegree/`)

This program explores how to integrate AI and machine learning into real-world product management. Key topics include identifying high-impact use cases, collaborating with technical teams, defining success metrics, and designing responsible AI products.

**Projects include:**
- Framing ML product opportunities with clear success metrics
- Creating AI delivery roadmaps across business and engineering teams
- Identifying risks related to bias, explainability, and misuse of AI

---

### 2. Data Product Manager Nanodegree (`data-product-manager-nanodegree/`)

This program focuses on using data science and analytics to shape product direction. Topics include infrastructure strategy, product KPIs, and iteration planning based on quantitative insights.

**Projects include:**
- Evaluating monetization performance and recommending pricing changes
- Designing a scalable data infrastructure strategy
- Conducting activation and retention cohort analyses

---

### 3. Growth Product Manager Nanodegree (`growth-product-manager-nanodegree/`)

This program focuses on product-led growth strategies, from user acquisition and activation to retention and monetization. Emphasis is placed on experimentation and building scalable growth loops.

**Projects include:**
- Developing a growth loop and go-to-market plan for a DTC snack brand
- Running activation and retention funnel analyses for a Slack-style app
- Proposing monetization improvements for a B2B SaaS company

---

### 4. Generative AI Nanodegree (`generative-ai-nanodegree/`)

This program focuses on building products powered by large language models (LLMs). Projects emphasize prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and efficient deployment using parameter-efficient techniques.

**Projects include:**
- Fine-tuning a BERT-based model using LoRA (PEFT) on the `dair-ai/emotion` dataset
- Training and evaluating emotion classification pipelines using Hugging Face and PyTorch

---

### 5. Natural Language Processing Nanodegree (`natural-language-processing/`)

*(Coming soon)*  
This upcoming track will explore foundational NLP concepts including tokenization, sequence modeling, and applications such as sentiment analysis, summarization, and machine translation.
