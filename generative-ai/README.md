# Generative AI Projects

This folder contains hands-on projects, notebooks, and experiments completed as part of the **Udacity Generative AI Nanodegree**.

As a product manager building deeper technical skills, these projects reflect my exploration of foundational and applied concepts in modern generative AI â€” including large language models (LLMs), prompt engineering, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and ethical AI deployment.

## ðŸ“Œ Contents

### ðŸ§  PEFT Emotion Classifier
- Fine-tuned a BERT-based model using **LoRA adapters** and the **PEFT** framework
- Trained on the `dair-ai/emotion` dataset to classify text by emotional tone
- Includes training, evaluation, and comparison to baseline performance
- *(See `peft-emotion-classifier.ipynb` for full walkthrough)*

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries

- Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers & PEFT
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Datasets: `dair-ai/emotion`, others TBD
