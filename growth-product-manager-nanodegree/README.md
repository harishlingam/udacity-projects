# SaaS Monetization Model – Priceless Penny Project

In this project, I built a monetization model for a post-revenue B2B SaaS business and then adapted it to explore the impact of a different pricing scheme. The analysis is based on a hypothetical company with a defined product, pricing structure, and recent performance data.
